## Survival Analysis report

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r dataloading}
#Create a function to load the data from the /data folder
load_data<-function(){
  # create db connection
  conn <- dbConnect(SQLite(), './data/data.sqlite')
  
  # pull the fires table into RAM
  fires <- tbl(conn, "Fires") %>% collect()
  
  # disconnect from db
  dbDisconnect(conn)

  return(fires)  
}

# Calling the function
data <-load_data()
```

## EDA

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r missing_values, echo=FALSE}
# Some columns have mainly empty values so we decide to clean them out
clean_data <- data %>%
              select(-Shape, -OBJECTID,
                     -ICS_209_PLUS_INCIDENT_JOIN_ID,
                     -ICS_209_PLUS_COMPLEX_JOIN_ID,
                     -MTBS_ID,-MTBS_FIRE_NAME,
                     -COMPLEX_NAME,
                     -NWCG_CAUSE_AGE_CATEGORY)

# We also remove anything that is a local ID
clean_data <- clean_data %>%
              select(-LOCAL_FIRE_REPORT_ID, 
                     -LOCAL_INCIDENT_ID,
                     -FIRE_CODE,
                     -FIRE_NAME,
                     -COUNTY,
                     -FIPS_CODE,
                     -FIPS_NAME)
```

Now we want to filter our all rows which does not contains values in either one of those columns: DISCOVERY_DATE, DISCOVERY_TIME, CONT_DATE and CONT_TIME

```{r}
clean_data <- clean_data %>%
                filter(DISCOVERY_DATE != "" & !is.na(DISCOVERY_DATE) &
                         DISCOVERY_TIME != "" & !is.na(DISCOVERY_TIME) & 
                        CONT_DATE != "" & !is.na(CONT_DATE) & 
                         CONT_TIME != "" & !is.na(CONT_TIME) )
```

Note that we are now down to 1,276,794 data points.

## Data engineering

We now want to calculate the time each fire ran until they were stopped.
We first have to create a new column for the exact date and time for both category. We calculate this difference in Hours.

```{r}
clean_data <- clean_data %>% 
                  mutate(FIRE_START_DATE = as.POSIXct(paste(DISCOVERY_DATE, DISCOVERY_TIME), format = "%m/%d/%Y %H%M"),
                         FIRE_END_DATE = as.POSIXct(paste(CONT_DATE, CONT_TIME), format = "%m/%d/%Y %H%M"))  %>%
                  mutate(FIRE_TIME_HOUR = as.numeric(difftime(FIRE_END_DATE, FIRE_START_DATE, units="hours"))) %>%
                  mutate(DISCOVERY_TIME = as.numeric(substr(DISCOVERY_TIME, 1, 2))) %>%
                  select(-DISCOVERY_DATE, -CONT_DATE, -CONT_TIME)
```

We plot the histogram of the running time to check the data distribution:

```{r}
# Plot histogram
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = FIRE_TIME_HOUR)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Values", x = "Values", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```
We realize that a lot of fire have been running for 0 minutes. It is probably minor fires and were just inputed in the system for statistics purposes. We will also exclude them.

```{r}
clean_data <- clean_data %>%
                filter(FIRE_TIME_HOUR != 0 )
```

We are now down to 1,142,901 data points:

```{r}
# Plot histogram
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = FIRE_TIME_HOUR)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Values", x = "Values", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```
The maximum time in the actual data is 8759.67 hours, which corresponds to 365 days (so a year).
It seems unrealistic, so to cater with the fact we might have bad inputs, we will filter out all data that have a running time longer than a month (30*24= 720 H)

```{r}
clean_data <- clean_data %>%
                filter(FIRE_TIME_HOUR <= 720 )
```

```{r}
# Plot histogram
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = FIRE_TIME_HOUR)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Values", x = "Values", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```
We finalize the data to add event = 1, to indicate that no data has to be censored.
```{r}
clean_data$event <- 1  # No censored data (all fires finished)

```

## Data analysis

Checking if the type of fire (Human vs Natural) has an impact on the survival time.

```{r}
test <- clean_data %>%
          filter(NWCG_CAUSE_CLASSIFICATION != "Missing data/not specified/undetermined")

surv_object <- Surv(time = test$FIRE_TIME_HOUR, 
                    event = test$event)

km_fit <- survfit(surv_object ~ NWCG_CAUSE_CLASSIFICATION, data = test)

ggsurvplot(km_fit, conf.int = TRUE, pval = TRUE, 
           legend.title = "Fire Type",
           xlab = "Fire Running Time (Hours)", 
           title = "Kaplan-Meier Curve by Fire Type")
```
We can see that Natural fires tend to run for longer.

In the human cases, are Arson started fires more at risk of propagation than other type of human fires?

```{r}
test <- clean_data %>%
          filter(NWCG_CAUSE_CLASSIFICATION == "Human") %>%
          mutate(type=ifelse(NWCG_GENERAL_CAUSE=="Arson/incendiarism", "Arson","Other"))

surv_object <- Surv(time = test$FIRE_TIME_HOUR, 
                    event = test$event)

km_fit <- survfit(surv_object ~ type, data = test)

ggsurvplot(km_fit, conf.int = TRUE, pval = TRUE, 
           legend.title = "Fire Type",
           xlab = "Fire Running Time (Hours)", 
           title = "Kaplan-Meier Curve by Fire Type")
```

It does not seems so.

Does the time of the day (morning/afternoon) has an impact on the duration of the fire:

```{r}
test <- clean_data %>%
          mutate(period = ifelse(hour(FIRE_START_DATE) < 12, "Morning", "Afternoon"))

surv_object <- Surv(time = clean_data$FIRE_TIME_HOUR, 
                    event = clean_data$event)

km_fit <- survfit(surv_object ~ period, data = test)

ggsurvplot(km_fit, conf.int = TRUE, pval = TRUE, 
           legend.title = "Fire Type",
           xlab = "Fire Running Time (Hours)", 
           title = "Kaplan-Meier Curve by Fire Type")
```
It does not seem to make any difference.

We want to check if there is a difference between all fires before 2015 and after


```{r}
test <- clean_data %>%
          mutate(period = ifelse(FIRE_YEAR < 2015, "Before 2015", "After 2015"))

surv_object <- Surv(time = clean_data$FIRE_TIME_HOUR, 
                    event = clean_data$event)

km_fit <- survfit(surv_object ~ period, data = test)

ggsurvplot(km_fit, conf.int = TRUE, pval = TRUE, 
           legend.title = "Fire Type",
           xlab = "Fire Running Time (Hours)", 
           title = "Kaplan-Meier Curve by Fire Type")
```
